hey hey
i'm drew emery, pleased to meet you!
to be honest, i don't know what brought you here
BUT i'm interested in finding out

my interest in computer science and web technologies first started at (CUhackit)[https://cuhack.it]; 
through a lot of exploration and endless amounts of support from my peers, i ended up getting to work with 
some really cool people and learn a lot about cloud services.

the hackathon community taught me a lot about the value of collaboration. i used to say not to bring SWE's to
my SME fight but i've since learned we'll get to our goals faster together. so SWE, SME, or any other TLA, let's 
recreate the wheel together.

for work i'm an identity solutions engineer @auth0 / @okta
i make terrible websites on the side

if you're in seattle and want some restaurant recommendations or to chat over coffee feel free to get in touch!

i can most reliably be reached at: drew@emery.guru
